    "### Wave-Particle Duality\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum physics reveals that all particles (like electrons, photons) exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. This duality is demonstrated in the famous double-slit experiment where particles create an interference pattern when passing through two slits, behaving like waves, but are detected as individual particles.\n",

    "$$\\Delta x \\Delta p \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}$$\n",
