                "Gemini is Google's multimodal AI model family, designed to work seamlessly across different data types including text, code, images, video, and audio. It represents one of the most advanced multimodal architectures, built to understand and reason across different forms of information simultaneously.\n",

                "\n",
                "- **Multimodal Capabilities**: Natively processes text, images, audio, video, and code\n",
                "- **Multi-step Reasoning**: Demonstrates advanced reasoning abilities across problems\n",
                "- **Multiple Size Variants**: Available as Gemini Ultra, Pro, and Nano for different deployment scenarios\n",
                "- **Flexible Input Processing**: Can accept and work with multiple input types in a single prompt\n",
                "- **Advanced Context Understanding**: Interprets complex relationships between different elements in multimodal data\n",

                "\n",
                "- Is trained from the ground up as a multimodal system (rather than bolting separate models together)\n",
                "- Uses a Transformer-based architecture but with significant modifications for multimodal processing\n",
                "- Employs specialized attention mechanisms for cross-modal understanding\n",
                "- Utilizes Google's TPUv4 and TPUv5e systems for training at scale\n",

                "- **Gemini Ultra**: Largest and most capable model for highly complex tasks\n",
                "- **Gemini Pro**: Balanced model for a wide range of tasks\n",
                "- **Gemini Nano**: Efficient model designed to run directly on mobile devices\n",
