                "U-Net is a convolutional neural network architecture designed specifically for biomedical image segmentation. It was introduced in 2015 by Olaf Ronneberger, Philipp Fischer, and Thomas Brox at the University of Freiburg. The architecture gets its name from its U-shaped design.\n",

                "\n",
                "The U-Net architecture consists of two main paths:\n",
                "\n",
                "1. **Contracting path (encoder)**: A series of convolutional and max pooling operations that downsample the input image, capturing context.\n",
                "2. **Expansive path (decoder)**: A series of upsampling and convolutional operations that upsample feature maps, enabling precise localization.\n",
                "\n",
                "A key innovation of U-Net is the use of skip connections between corresponding layers in the contracting and expansive paths, which helps preserve spatial information lost during downsampling.\n",
